  'venus':
      '''Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.
Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Mariner 2 in 1962), and the first to be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970).

  'uranus': '''
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, the third largest and the fourth most massive of the eight planets in the Solar System. It was named after the Greek god of the sky, Uranus.

  'saturn': '''
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, the third largest and the fourth most massive of the eight planets in the Solar System. It was named after the Greek god of the sky, Uranus.''',
  'neptune': '''
  Neptune or Neptune is the eighth planet in the Solar System, the last one from the Sun since the reclassification of Pluto to the category of dwarf planet, in 2006. Belonging to the group of gaseous giants, it has a slightly smaller size than that of Uranus, but largest mass, equivalent to 17 Earth masses.
''',
  'mercury':
      '''Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.
Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.
Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface on April 30, 2015.

  'mars': '''
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, the second smallest in the Solar System. Named after the Roman deity of war, it is often described as the "Red Planet" because the predominant iron oxide on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.

  'jupyter': '''
Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, both in diameter and mass, and is the fifth closest to the Sun. It is less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun, yet it is 2.5 times the mass of all the other planets combined. It is a gaseous planet, along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
''',
  'earth':
      '''Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor and support life.
Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days.
According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms.
